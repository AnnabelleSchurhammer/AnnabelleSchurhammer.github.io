            <h1> Our Planet </h1>
            <p>
                Earth is the only planet that we know of that can support life. We are just the right distance from the sun  to be the perfect temperature to support life. The atmosphere, a layer of gasses, around our planet acts like a shied protecting us from harmful radiation and keeping our temperature just right. There are many different things like:, energy, water, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen that need to be balanced for our planet to be healthy so we can life on it.

            <h1> What's Wrong </h1>
            <p>
                There are more and more people on the planet everyday. We burn a lot of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas to produce energy. This energy is used in our everyday lives like for light, cooking, heat, and cars. Burning fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide which goes out into our atmosphere. We are producing so much carbon dioxide that our atmosphere is becoming unbalanced. The carbon dioxide is causing our planet to heat up by trapping heat inside the atmosphere. This is causing extreme weather, rise in water level and is endangering us and our world.

            <h1> Plants Help </h1>
            <p>
               Almost all plants take carbon dioxide out of the air and turn it into Oxygen, this is what we need to breath. Normally the bigger the plant and the more green leaves it has the more carbon dioxide it absorbs and turns into energy. Plants not only help clean the air, they can provide food, give a home to animals, suck up water to prevent flooding, keep the ground together so reduce earth slips, act as a wind breaker and shade you fro the sun which helps keep your heat and air cone electricity low, and of course they make everything look pretty!
